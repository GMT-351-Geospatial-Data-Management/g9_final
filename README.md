# Charging Stations Map Application
# Overview
This application utilizes the powerful capabilities of the Quick OSM library within the QGIS application to seamlessly retrieve data related to charging stations in Poland. The process involves crafting custom Python code tailored to the project's objectives and efficiently reorganizing the data.

# Data Integration
We established a connection between PostgreSQL and GeoServer using PostGIS, ensuring smooth data flow into the database. The integration was facilitated by installing the PostGIS plugin. The image provided showcases the successful loading of data into the database.

# GeoServer Configuration
Empowering our project with the dynamic capabilities of GeoServer, we meticulously crafted a Workspace within its framework. Essential workspace settings were configured, and the data from the PostGIS and PostgreSQL database was prepared for use with GeoServer.

# Visualization
We chose a suitable style to visualize the data in alignment with our project goals. This step is crucial as it determines how users will perceive the information on the map. The dynamic nature of GeoServer allowed us to showcase the data from the PostgreSQL database effectively.

# Application Summary
In summary, this application serves as an informative tool for locating charging stations on the map. Leveraging the chosen map base, it provides users with a practical system for not only identifying the nearest charging station for a vehicle with a low battery but also checking its availability, current status, level, capacity, and other relevant features.
