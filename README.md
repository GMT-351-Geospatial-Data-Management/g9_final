First of all, utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Quick OSM library within the QGIS application, we seamlessly retrieved the data pertaining to charging stations in Poland. By crafting Python code tailored to our desired project, we adeptly reorganized our data to suit our objectives. We provided the connection between PostgreSQL and GeoServer via Postgis. This image shows that data is being loaded into the database.We installed the postgis plugin to the database. Empowering our project with the dynamic capabilities of GeoServer, we crafted a WorkSpace within its framework.We did the important workspace settings.We made the data from postgis and postgresql database ready for use with GeoServer. We chose the style to visualize the data in accordance with our project. Finally, we showed how we display the data in the postgreSQL database via geoserver. In summary, in this application, we  informed about the charging stations on the map. Thanks to the map base we use, it provides a useful system to the users by not only finding out the nearest charging station of a vehicle whose battery is running out, but also seeing whether it is currently available or unavailable, its level, capacity and some other features.
